# R_project -- Telecommunication Compay

The telecomunication company provided the LSU team with different datasets about demographics and rate changes in order to built a model which tries to predict the churn event. 

To collect more data and to enrich the dataset, a table containing the average income per states in 2015 was scraped from the web.

Different data manipulation techniques were used to reshape the data (reformat the variables).

To see the relation among different variables, three graphics were built using the ggplot package. 

Finally, the objective of the Churn predictive model is to assign to the customers a measure of the propensity to abandonment. For this reason, this analysis provides also a logistic regression model with the binary target variable being "Churn".
